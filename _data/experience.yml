  to: May 2023
  description: Spearheaded the development of a tailored Adversarial Machine Learning solution for NLP, enhancing interpretability through innovative techniques and research.
               Implemented a tripartite system for model interpretation, combining adversarial attack samples, local SHAP value analysis, and global interpretability insights, which resulted in a marked reduction in bias and model interpretation variability.
               Made a contribution (Creating a new Module for Interpretability) to the Italian Government's CybersecH project named AIA Guard.
